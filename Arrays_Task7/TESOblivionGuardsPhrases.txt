Stop! You violated the law!
Stop right there, criminal scum!
Then pay with your blood!
By the Nine Divines, assault! Assault!
By the Gods, there’s a psychopath on the loose!
I saw you steal that.
So, you were at that party in Chorrol...
Let me guess — someone stole your sweetroll.
I’ve got my eye on you.
Keep your nose clean, and we won’t have any problems.
Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence.
